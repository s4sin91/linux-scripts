Files have 3 categories of user which they apply.

(i) user: The file is owned by a user, normally the one who created the file.

(ii) group: The file is also owned by a single  group, usually the primary group of the user who created the file, but this can be changed.

(iii) other: Different permission can be set for the owning user, the owning group, and for all other user on the system that are not the user or a member of the owning group. other ‡®Æ‡®§‡®≤‡®¨ ‡®®‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®â‡®π group ‡®¶‡®æ part ‡®π‡©à, ‡®®‡®æ ‡®π‡©Ä ‡®â‡®∏‡®¶‡®æ owner ‡®π‡©à‡•§like i create file ‡®§‡©á ‡®Æ‡©à ‡®â‡®∏‡®¶‡®æ owner ‡®¨‡®£ ‡®ó‡®ø‡®Ü, ‡®§‡©á ‡®â‡®π‡©Ä particular ‡®ú‡©ã owner ‡®π‡©Å‡©∞‡®¶‡®æ ‡®â‡®∏ ‡®®‡®æ‡®Æ ‡®¶‡®æ group ‡®¨‡®£ ‡®ú‡®æ‡®Ç‡®¶‡®æ ‡®§‡©á ‡®â‡®π ‡®â‡®∏‡®¶‡®æ member primary group ‡®≤‡©à ‡®≤‡©à‡®Ç‡®¶‡®æ automatically‡•§ ‡®á‡®∏‡®¶‡©á ‡®á‡®≤‡®æ‡®µ‡®æ ‡®π‡©ã‡®∞ ‡®∏‡®æ‡®∞‡©á others ‡®¶‡©Ä category ‡®µ‡®ø‡©±‡®ö count ‡®π‡©Å‡©∞‡®¶‡©á‡•§
